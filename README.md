#Code Fellows JS-401
##Node Ecosystem

This assignment consisted of creating module called reader.js which exports a single function. The function takes in an array of file paths and returns a mapped array of strings showing the first 5 characters of the file path data. If an error occurs the callback will stop.

## Getting Started
- Fork this repository: https://github.com/jlhiskey/03-async-and-callbacks
- Clone this repository onto your local device.
- The local repository should now contain a folder structure that matches the one shown below.
    - lib/ : contains module definitions
    - data/ : contains the text files used by the program
    - --test__/ : contains unit tests
 - Now in your terminal you will need to install dependencies using 
the command:  npm i 
    - This will create a package.json file on your local device.
- To run test open your terminal use the command: npm run test
